## Summary
The game we've created is called Sunken Echoes. We wanted to make a game with unconventional controls with a great story. The main character must find out what really happened in this underwater town by exploring. There is a story that you must uncover by exploring different areas and defeating different bosses.

## Key Plot Ideas
- Start on a long, dimly lit road with several buildings on either side
- A local police officer kills people and disposes of their bodies in the nearby lake
- The local church knows about this via confession
- Newspaper prints about missing people throughout the town slowly tell the story along with the NPC’s themselves (they are the people that were killed)
- Secrets hidden throughout levels giving this plot
- Library, apartments, final room in police station
- Slowly realize that the main character is the police officer, after his death. This city is a manifestation of his past and he is now here as punishment.
- Victims were drowned 
- Find newspaper clippings
- Overhear confession between the police officer and the priest:
  -Priest: “You’ve gone too far this time…”
## Unconventional Controls
- Mic
- The map is usually pitch black, but by making noise, the user can light up the area around him by shooting light particles out
- Sound is necessary to light up the map, but it will also alert nearby monsters to your location
## How to Play:
- WASD to move
- E or F to interact with items (pick items up, use them, or open doors)
- Right click to attack with crowbar (must have picked up crowbar)

- Tab to show inventory

#### 2 - Church
- Priest: “What a shame” → dead body in baptismal font
- Librarian in church room: “Have you seen a boy around here? He must have wandered off again.” *Sigh*
- When you try to go into the confessional, priest talks to you: “You can’t go in there without a priest.” “Aren’t you a priest?” “Yes but I’m very busy. Somebody took apart the statues of the saints in the basement. What to do…”
- 3 Statues of saints → match form of death with saint (ex: put spear into hole)
- Look at icons around the church → talk to priest about it and he gives you information about the librarian’s item (maybe in lost and found)

- Lost woods puzzle (with doors) 
- Must go through the doors in the correct order
- SOLUTION: Left, Up, Up, Left, Right

    - Upon unlocking the door, they find the newspaper clippings about the killings. The librarian enters and says “This says I’m dead. How can this be?” Then she transforms into a monster and begins to chase you down a long hallway filled with obstacles. If she touches you, the chase scene restarts. If you get to the end, with her last breath she says “I can’t breathe”, which relates to how she was killed (drowned by you).
